## 🤝 Project Origin & Contributions

This project originated as a **group academic project** developed collaboratively as part of a microcontrollers course.

After the initial group version, **I independently expanded and improved the project**, focusing on:

- System architecture redesign
- ESP32 firmware organization and simulation
- Backend API development
- Frontend dashboard implementation
- Documentation and system integration

All improvements, extensions, and architectural decisions presented here were developed by me.

## 🔧 System Architecture

- **ESP32 Firmware** collects posture data from sensors  
- **Backend API** processes and stores posture data  
- **Frontend Dashboard** displays real-time posture feedback
